        Calculates all reachable positions on the board starting from a given position, without a predefined limit on movement points
        and with variable weights for each edge.

        This generalized Dijkstra's algorithm computes the minimum "movement cost" (distance) from the starting position ("start_pos")
        to all other positions on the board. It stops when no further reachable positions with a finite movement cost are available.

        The algorithm works as follows:
        
        1. Initialize a "distances" dictionary where each position on the board starts with an "infinite" distance, representing
        unreachable positions. Set the distance of the starting position ("start_pos") to 0, as it requires no movement cost to
        "reach" itself.

        2. Use a priority queue ("min_heap") to keep track of positions with their current movement costs. Add the starting position
        to the queue with a cost of 0.

        3. Initialize an empty set "visited" to keep track of positions that have already been processed.

        4. Enter a loop to process each position from the queue:
            - Pop the position with the smallest current movement cost from the queue.
            - If this position has already been visited, skip it.
            - Mark the current position as visited.
            - Add the position to "reachable" if it's reachable within the computed cost.

        5. For each neighbor of the current position, calculate the new tentative distance from the starting position
        (current position's distance + movement cost to the neighbor).
            - If this new distance is less than the currently recorded distance for that neighbor, update the neighborâ€™s distance
            and push it onto the queue with its updated distance.

        6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the queue is empty.

        The result is a dictionary of all positions on the board with their minimum movement cost from the starting position.
        This allows the player to see which squares are accessible within their computed movement range.

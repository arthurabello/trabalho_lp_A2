# Warbound üèπ‚öîÔ∏è

*"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles."*
*-Sun Tzu*

## Introduction
Warbound is a turn-based strategy game, developed with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). The main purpose of this is to simulate how ancient battles would have been fought, strategically and tactically. The player is induced to think as a general, and make strategic decisions to avoid failing in battle.

## About the Game
In Warbound, players control armies with diverse unit types including infantry, cavalry, and archers. Each player chooses a historical general with unique abilities before the battle begins. The game's core mechanics involve:

- Strategic unit movement [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/units/base/unit_movement.py)
- Tactical formations [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/units/base/unit_formation.py)
- Unit orientation on the battlefield [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/units/base/unit_formation.py)
- Army management [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/units/base/unit_formation.py)
- Terrain-based advantages [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/units/base/unit_formation.py)
- Unit-specific combat abilities [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/unit_combat_mixin.py)
- General-specific advantages (and disadvantages) [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/unit_combat_mixin.py)
- Realistic combat mechanics, with a probabilistic system [(source)](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/unit_combat_mixin.py)

The game includes a comprehensive in-game [tutorial](https://github.com/arthurabello/warbound/blob/main/src/classes/menu/tutorial/tutorial_manager.py) for new players.

## Objective
The victory condition is to defeat the enemy by either eliminating their general or destroying their entire army.
